* Document the GCE init steps and build steps for a future blog post (similar to https://michael.bacarella.com/2021/11/10/tutorial-minimum-viable-mirage-unikernel-web-server-on-gce/)
* Set up github actions to build the image (see https://www.riseos.com/blog/2016/09/13/continuously-deploying-mirage-unikernels-to-google-compute-engine-using-circle-ci.html)
* Configure letsencrypt (see https://github.com/mbacarella/mirage-mvgce)
* Add actual content (have a look at https://github.com/roburio/unipi)
* Configure IPv6 (looks like GCE doesn't really support IPv6 yet but it's in alpha...)
